This project analyzes MLB team efficiency from 1990 to 2014 by comparing payrolls to actual winning percentages. It retrieves team data from a SQLite database, standardizes payrolls for fair year-to-year comparison, and calculates expected winning percentages based on payroll. The difference between actual and expected winning percentages (efficiency), is then visualized for teams like the Oakland A’s and New York Yankees using Matplotlib. The project also calculates summary statistics, including each team’s average efficiency and their best and worst performance years, providing insights into how effectively teams used their payroll to secure wins.
